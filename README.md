Brief Background

I am Glen Yali, a PhD Candidate at the Department of [Geospatial Science](https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/schools-colleges/science/research/research-areas/geospatial-science), [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au/). My study is on monitoring tropical forest dynamics from space-borne data to support REDD+ Implementations in PNG.

Below is the Landsat Timeseries for PNG since 1984 illustrating when PNG had full satellite coverage retrospectively.
